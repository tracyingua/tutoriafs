To run a Django project, begin by cloning the project repository from the remote source using the command "git clone https://github.com/tracyingua/tutoriafs.git". After cloning, navigate into the project directory using cd folder name, making sure to replace "folder name" with the actual name of the folder that was created.

Once inside the project directory, the next step is to install Django using the command "pip install django" (if django is not yet installed), followed by installing the Django REST Framework, which is commonly used for building APIs in Django. You can do this by running "pip install djangorestframework".

After installing the necessary dependencies, it’s time to set up the database. First, create the migration files by running "python manage.py makemigrations", which prepares the database schema. Then, apply those migrations using "python manage.py migrate", which updates the actual database based on the migrations.

Before starting the server, it’s a good practice to create a superuser so you can access the Django admin panel. You can do this by running "python manage.py createsuperuser" and then following the prompts to set up a username, email, and password.

Finally, to launch the application, start the development server with the command "python manage.py runserver". You can now visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your browser to view the running project, and log in to the admin panel at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ using the superuser credentials you just created.
